# Monorepo Structure for Multi-Tenant, AI-Powered Retail Application

This repository is designed for a **multi-tenant microservice architecture** with a **React Native frontend** and a backend powered by **NestJS**. It supports separate databases for retailers, an AI recommendation engine, and mobile-first user interaction.

## **Description of Components**

### **apps/**
- **`mobile/`**: The React Native mobile frontend for retailer and customer interactions.
- **`backend-api/`**: The API Gateway that routes requests to various microservices. Implements middleware for tenant identification (e.g., based on subdomain, JWT, or API key).
- **`product-service/`**: Handles retailer-specific product data. Connects dynamically to retailer databases using tenant-aware logic.
- **`recommendation-service/`**: Provides AI-driven product recommendations based on tenant-specific datasets.
- **`auth-service/`**: Manages authentication and authorization for both retailers and end-users.
- **`admin-dashboard/` (optional)**: Web interface for administrators to manage retailers, monitor usage, and configure settings.

### **libs/**
- **`common/`**: Shared utilities such as validation schemas, constants, and helper functions.
- **`database/`**: Multi-tenant MongoDB connection logic. Includes:
  - `mongoose-connection.ts`: Core logic for establishing MongoDB connections.
  - `tenant-database.service.ts`: Dynamically resolves and manages connections to tenant-specific databases.
- **`ai-utils/`**: Shared AI utilities for preprocessing, model training, and inference.

### **services/**
- **`ai/`**: Contains pipelines for training and inference of the CNN model used for recommendations and similarity detection.
- **`storage/`**: Handles centralized storage for retailer data, including product images. Integrates with AWS S3 or MongoDB's GridFS.

### **config/**
- **`dev.env`**: Configuration for development.
- **`prod.env`**: Configuration for production.
- **`tenant-config.json`**: Stores metadata about tenants (e.g., tenant ID, database URIs, etc.).

### **scripts/**
- **`migrate-tenants.ts`**: Script to manage tenant-specific database migrations.
- **`seed-database.ts`**: Script to seed initial data into tenant databases.
- **`manage-tenants.ts`**: CLI for managing tenant operations (e.g., adding new tenants, updating configurations).

### **tests/**
- Contains end-to-end and integration tests for all services and shared utilities.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**
- **React Native**: For the mobile-first interface.

### **Backend**
- **NestJS**: For building the backend services in a microservice architecture.
- **MongoDB**: For multi-tenant databases (separate databases per retailer).
- **Mongoose**: ORM for MongoDB.

### **AI**
- **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch**: For training and inference of the CNN model.
- **NumPy and Pandas**: For data preprocessing.

### **Infrastructure**
- **Docker**: For containerizing services.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating microservices in production.
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka**: For inter-service communication and real-time updates.
- **AWS S3 or GridFS**: For storing retailer images and other files.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd monorepo
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Environment Setup**
- Copy and configure `.env` files for development and production in the `config/` directory.

### **4. Run Services**
Start individual services or all services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### **5. Test the System**
Run tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
```bash
npm test
```

## **Development Notes**
1. **Tenant Identification**:
   - Middleware in `backend-api` ensures all requests are routed based on the tenant context.
2. **Dynamic Database Connections**:
   - Use `libs/database/mongoose-connection.ts` for dynamic tenant-specific MongoDB connections.
3. **Real-Time Data Sync**:
   - Use RabbitMQ/Kafka for synchronizing retailer updates (e.g., product changes).
